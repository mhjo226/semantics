<p> James Hooten has always had a passion for athletic footwear. In fact, he's been repainting them
for years as a hobby! It wasn't until 2017, though, that James decided to make his hobby a hustle.

In the almost two years of Soul on Soles' existence, James has garnered business nationwide and plans on expanding
even more. All business and no play just isn't his style, though. James makes plenty of time for his wife and four
energetic daughters. The family and business just go hand in hand!</p>
